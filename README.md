# Profilestr
Web-app that let's you see all notes from specific `npub`.

### Motivation and tech-stack
I wanted to try to create a functioning nostr-app using nothing but plain javascript without a build process [no-build].

### Dependencies
- Nostr-tools package, pre-built and minified from CDN

### Status
Very much work-in-progress 🚧, but this documents my journey through developing on nostr protocol.
